      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We render timely and high quality translation services from the English source to the targeted IsiXhosa language. 
        IsiXhosa is a Nguni language and is one of the official languages from the eleven languages spoken in South Africa. It is spoken
        approximately by 8.2 million people and by other 11 million as a second language in South Africa, mostly in Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng and Northern Cape. Our intent is to provide prompt and reliable translations or interpretations of written or spoken thoughts between languages. We translate all kinds of documents, manuals, scriptural and non-scriptural texts, audio visuals etc. Our translations are presently focused on IsiXhosa as a target language.
        As the company expands in the future, our vision is to have on board professional translators of the other South African official languages. We also intend on expanding the business in 2023 by offering online IsiXhosa lessons to the world.

        LANGUAGE PROOF REVIEW (LPR)<br><br>
        Language reviewer checks the translation for correct grammar, style, and insures it sounds natural. Primary concern should be with the correctness and clarity of the translation. Reads the translation without comparing it to the source text, correcting anything that is hard to understand or is unnatural.  Proofreader ensures that the translation is free from errors in spelling, verifies punctuation, scriptures, and other references. Checks for completeness, consistency, and mechanical correctness.
        <br><br>Readiness and Correctness<br><br>
        Use a checklist to ensure the translation is free from errors in spelling, punctuation, and reference. The translation has been read word by word, checking for correct capitalization and punctuation. All text and names that remain in English are spelled correctly each time they appear. All quotes have a beginning and ending curly quote, including single curly quotes. All quotes are made correctly. Ellipses are used correctly.
        <br><br>Completeness, Consistency and Faithfulness<br><br>
        Mark all grammatical mistakes, explain why they were mistakes, and provide a clearly written suggestion to correct them. Mark unclear wording, explain why it was unclear and provide a clearly written suggestion to make the wording
