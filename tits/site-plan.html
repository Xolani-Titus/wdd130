      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We render timely and high quality translation services from the English source to the targeted IsiXhosa language. 
        IsiXhosa is a Nguni language and is one of the official languages from the eleven languages spoken in South Africa. It is spoken
        approximately by 8.2 million people and by other 11 million as a second language in South Africa, mostly in Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng and Northern Cape. Our intent is to provide prompt and reliable translations or interpretations of written or spoken thoughts between languages. We translate all kinds of documents, manuals, scriptural and non-scriptural texts, audio visuals etc. Our translations are presently focused on IsiXhosa as a target language.
        As the company expands in the future, our vision is to have on board professional translators of the other South African official languages. We also intend on expanding the business in 2023 by offering online IsiXhosa lessons to the world.

        TRANSLATION (TRL)<br><br>Translate the file ensuring that the doctrines are correct and that translations are faithful to source text, being as literal as possible without losing the meaning of the source. Consult and update word lists. If necessary, start a glossary that will be shared. Check spelling and punctuation. Check the translation guide (TRG) while translating for any clarification and warning, and check the reference materials as needed to verify the context of the translations.   
        <br><br>Readiness and Correctness<br><br>Check for correctness: names, titles, places, dates, page numbers. etc. Compare table of contents and the text to ensure that they are consistent: Chapter titles, Subtitles, Headings, and subheadings. Compare the key words with the Official Terminology List to ensure they are correctly spelled and check to see that phrases which occur repeatedly through the text have been translated the same way in the same context each time.
