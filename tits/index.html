        <p>Soyama Translation Services renders timely and high quality translation services from the English source to the targeted IsiXhosa language. IsiXhosa is a Nguni language and is one of the official languages from the eleven languages spoken in South Africa. It is spoken approximately by 8.2 million people and by other 11 million as a second language in South Africa, mostly in Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng and Northern Cape. Our intent is to provide prompt and reliable translations or interpretations of written or spoken thoughts between languages. We translate all kinds of documents, manuals, scriptural and non-scriptural texts, audio visuals etc. Our translations are presently focused on IsiXhosa as a target language. As the company expands in the future, our vision is to have on board professional translators of the other South African official languages. We also intend on expanding the business in 2023 by offering online IsiXhosa lessons to the world language.
