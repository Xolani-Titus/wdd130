    <p> Hello class! I'm married to the most beautiful woman in the world.<br>
        That's myself and my lovely wife in the picture. We are married for <br> over a year now. We love 
        each other very much. We do not have children yet.<br> We are both BYUI students. We are pursuing degrees
        in Applied Health and <br>in Applied Technology. I completed a computer support certificate this past 
        semester. <br>We love each other's company. We both enjoy playing outdoor games. We love eating out.</p>

    <p> I'm a convert to the Church. I have been a member of the Church for almost 12 years now.<br> I served a 
        mission in England London from 2012-2014. I love how our Church is more than <br>just a religion but a 
        way of living. I love listening to the words of modern prophets and apostles.<br> My favorite
        quote from the recent General Conference by Elder D. Todd Christofferson: <br>"We ought not to think of God's
        plan as a cosmic vending machine where we (1) select <br> a desired blessing, (2) insert the required sum of
        good works, and (3) the order is promptly delivered." <br> These words were a voice of God to us when my wife and I 
        recently went through a testing of faith. <br>We accepted God's will and what He was saying to us.
    </p>
    <p>I look forward to learning together with you in this class. Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
